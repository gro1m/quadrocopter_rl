# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller

*Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly!*

This project relies on a quadcopter simulation provided by [Udacity Deep Learning](https://github.com/udacity/RL-Quadcopter-2):
The goal is to specify a task for the quadrocopter and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm! 

## Project Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/gro1m/quadrocopter_rl.git
cd quadrocopter_rl
```

2. Create and activate a new environment.

```
conda create -n quadcop python=3.6
source activate quadcop
```

3. Install libraries provided in requirements.sh via:
```
./requirements.sh
```

4. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook Quadcopter_Project.ipynb
```# rl_quadcopter
